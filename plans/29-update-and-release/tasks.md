# Tasks — One update path and release

[Plan](plan.md) · [Inputs](inputs.md)

Routes: **N** = normal (everything below very hard), **X** = very hard, **S** = super hard (see the [run contract](../../skills/astrid-dev-shared/run-contract.md)). Before editing, re-check the cited lines against the branch being built. Line numbers are from App `915bfa84`, Agent `a2c4ab7d`, Runtime `61e2c301`.

| Task / outcome | Route | Depends on | Scope | Focused proof | Progress |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1a — App (about 4 days)** | | | | | |
| UR-1 Update now only when the installed Astrid reports `self_update`, and the real reason whenever it can't run | N | — | app `src/shared/lib/updates/{useInstallerUpdate,updateOperation,resolveUpdate}.ts`, `src/integrations/runtime/client.ts`, `UpdateResolutionActions.tsx`, `SettingsModal/sections/AstridUpdatesSection.tsx`; surface update UI | Without `self_update`, Update now is hidden and the one line plus the command show; busy shows it disabled. Each status `reason` and POST `details.reason` has its own line; an unknown reason reads as needs repair | [ ] |
| UR-3 Setup block off update surfaces; Updates gains a repair entry | N | UR-1 | app `UpdateResolutionActions.tsx`, `ChatUpdateNeeded.tsx`, `SettingsModal/sections/{AstridStatusSection,AstridUpdatesSection,astridStatusCopy}` | No SetupBlock on update surfaces or the status section; a degraded direct install finds the plain install line under Updates | [ ] |
| UR-4 Chat update cards use the shared decision | N | UR-1, UR-3 | app `src/tools/video-editor/components/AgentChat/**` | One error renders one card; chat's action is "See updates" | [ ] |
| UR-5 Pinokio memory reads `identity.managed_by` | N | — | app `RuntimeConnectionProvider.tsx` | Through both the proxy and the door, Pinokio is recognised and never sees the installer command | [ ] |
| UR-6 Pinokio fully local serves update status | N | UR-5 | app `config/vite/localUpdateStatus.ts` | Under `vite preview` the status answers instead of 501, and the 501 test is inverted | [ ] |
| UR-7 Decision table test | N | UR-1–UR-4 | app update decision tests | Install type × situation, plus the negative cases in the plan | [ ] |
| UR-8 `release-guard` job | N | — | app `scripts/installer/**`, `.github/workflows/{test,served-manifest-canary}.yml`, `config/qualification/**`; contract release number | Tuple or bootstrap change without +1 fails; any other `release` change fails; it runs on pull requests and on push | [ ] |
| **Phase 1b — fully local (about 1.5 days)** | | | | | |
| UR-9 Fully local Update now through the in-page updater | X | UR-1 | app `updateOperation.ts` (`LocalPageUpdate`), `config/vite/localUpdatePage.ts`, `scripts/local-update*.mjs` | Spike confirms why `f2eca0bd5` hid it; a dev:local test updates through the page | [ ] |
| **Phase 1c — Release 10 (about 6.5–7.5 days)** | | | | | |
| UR-10 Update now works end to end | S | — | agent `astrid/installer/update_job*.py`, new e2e test; contract update helper | Agent test: the Runtime's real request through the real helper, prepare → accept → launch and recovery-needed, with fake `systemctl`/`systemd-run` | [ ] |
| UR-11 Runtime reports `self_update` and a reason in every state | X | UR-10 | runtime `astrid_runtime/update.py`; agent `update_job.py` availability; contract update status | `self_update` comes from the helper reporting its actions, on every OS; unclassified causes are `needs-repair`, Pinokio and source are `managed-elsewhere` | [ ] |
| UR-12 Hosted update can target a stand-in release | X | — (UR-11 if the fallback seam is chosen) | agent journey CI (`journey.yml`, `scripts/ci_*journey*.py`); runtime `update.py` only if the fallback seam is chosen, then after UR-11 | A probe on each OS runner chooses CI-level interception, or the owner-approved fallback seam | [ ] |
| UR-13 Hosted button-path update on every OS | X | UR-10–UR-12 | agent `journey_fresh_update.py`, `windows_update_journey.py`, `ci_journey_keepgoing.py`, `journey.yml` | The update leg of the three direct fresh rows POSTs through the door to a stand-in release | [ ] |
| **Review — before publishing** | | | | | |
| UR-R Up to three independent reviews of the integrated candidate | S | UR-1–UR-13 | all Plan 29 scopes (read-only review) | Each round produces either no blocking findings, or new routed task cards that are done before the next round; see [review rounds](#ur-r-review-rounds) | [ ] |
| UR-14 Publish Release 10 | N | all, including UR-R | app `public/install-manifest.json`, `runtime.lock.json` | Owner names the tuple and says go; `public/install*` frozen; not required; canary passes | [ ] |
| **Owner** | | | | | |
| Turn on branch protection on App `main`, requiring `release-guard`, up to date, including admins | owner | UR-8 | Settings show the required check | [ ] |

**Overlap with other projects:** Plan 09 IU-1 and IU-8 change the same update helper and transaction as UR-10, UR-11 and Plan 30's UR-16, so they run after them. Plan 10's Pinokio row work shares `pinokio_row_driver.py` with Plan 30's UR-18a.

## Task details

### UR-R Review rounds

This plan sets its own review policy, as the [run contract](../../skills/astrid-dev-shared/run-contract.md) allows.

1. **Run a round.** An independent S reviewer (Opus) reviews the integrated candidate across App, Agent, Runtime and launcher. It reviews against [the completion criteria and negative cases](plan.md#completion) and the recorded owner decisions. It returns each finding as a task card, with these fields:
   - outcome;
   - route (N, X or S, by the run contract);
   - scope;
   - dependencies;
   - focused proof.
2. **Do the findings.** The manager adds the cards here as `UR-R<round>.<n>`, orders any that overlap by dependency, and runs them like any other task.
3. **Run the next round** on the new candidate.

The stage stops after a round with no blocking findings, or after three rounds. A blocking finding still open after three rounds goes to the owner, not to a fourth round. Non-blocking findings are recorded, and are done only if the owner asks.


### UR-1 Update now only with `self_update`
- **The new field.** `self_update` is a new boolean on `GET /v1/update/status`. The existing `available` doesn't serve this purpose, because it reports true on macOS and Windows even though the helper fails.
- **Where the App gates it.** Gate in `useInstallerUpdate.ts` (about :60-64) and `canStartInstallerUpdate` (`updateOperation.ts:24-27`), so `start()` is gated too.
- **Behaviour today.** A missing field reads as false, so the button disappears for everyone until Release 10.
- **Fixtures.** About 14 caller tests that assume `available: true` need fixtures.

### UR-1 (continued): real refusal reason
- Read the POST refusal's `details.reason` (it's ignored today at `updateOperation.ts:134-141`).
- Stop dropping unknown reasons (`:17-22`).
- A 409 reconciliation has `kind`, not `reason`.

### UR-3 Setup block and repair
- **Remove** the SetupBlock renders at `UpdateResolutionActions.tsx:47,51`, `ChatUpdateNeeded.tsx:24` and `AstridStatusSection.tsx:120-123`.
- **The status section** says "Repair it under Updates." for a degraded direct install.
- **The Updates section** gains that repair entry: the plain install line, without `--update`.
- **Check in Agent code** that the plain line repairs a degraded install and respects autostart off.
- **Copy:** `astridStatusCopy.ts:9` promises instructions that will no longer appear, so it changes.

### UR-4 Chat cards
- **Today:** one error renders at `AgentChat.tsx:1318, 1632, 719-722`, `AgentChatMenu.tsx:321` and `NewChatMenu.tsx:286`.
- **Wording:** take the title and sentence from `updateNeededSentence`.
- **Hooks:** chat renders without providers (`TourChatPanel.tsx:164`), so use no required hook.

### UR-8 `release-guard`
- **Job:** a new `release-guard` job on `pull_request` and on push to `main`.
- **Base:** the PR base, or `github.event.before` on push.
- **Tuple bytes:** the manifest minus `release` and `required`, plus `public/install`, `install.ps1` and `install.sh`.
- **The rule:** if those bytes change, `release` goes up by exactly 1; otherwise it is unchanged.
- **`required`:** validate `0 ≤ required.release ≤ release` and a non-empty reason.
- **Tools:** `pin.mjs` stops writing `release`. The Agent's `regenerate_runtime_pins.py` already leaves it alone.
- **Delete:** `update-manifest.mjs`, the release-0 and baseline files, and `check-public-updater-candidate.*`.
- **Canary:** it also checks `release` and the bootstrap bytes.
- **Conflict to settle first:** open App draft PR #194 edits the same manifest.

### UR-9 Fully local Update now
- **Independent of the broken path.** The updater runs the installed Agent's `local_update` module and doesn't use the broken `reconcile` path, so it should work on existing installs (from source; to confirm).
- **No recorded reason it was hidden.** `f2eca0bd5` has no reason recorded. Its test name points at the npm route that was since removed.
- **Paths:**
  - Primary: Update now.
  - Secondary: the normal install command (owner decision of 7 Nov).

### UR-10 End to end
- **Merge the whole lane** in order: `7c9438f55`, `548c8f93f`, `eaa9996de`, `b97c43db8`, `a721da65a`. All five merge cleanly onto Agent main.
- **Fix the remaining mismatches the test finds**, which include:
  - the implicit prepare action;
  - refusal labelling;
  - the Runtime test stub's `launch_status: "started"`, which the Agent never emits.
- **Test setup:** Agent tests already import `astrid_runtime` at the pinned SHA. The test redirects prepare URLs by wrapping `_helper`, with no production change.

### UR-11 `self_update` and reasons
- **Where `self_update` comes from:** the helper's `availability` action lists its supported actions, and old helpers can't, so they read false. Move the probe from Linux-only (`update.py:103`) to every OS.
- **Reasons:**
  - Emit `reason` in every state, not only `none`.
  - Keep `busy`, `autostart-off` and `unsupported-service-manager`.
  - Add `needs-repair` (anything unclassified) and `managed-elsewhere` (Pinokio, source).
- **Compatibility:** older Apps ignore unknown keys (`client.ts:247-259`).
- **Tests to update:** those asserting the old shape (`test_update_jobs.py` around :433-441 and :489-530).

### UR-12 Stand-in target
- **What's in the way:** the update's URLs are constants (`update.py:27-29, 308-309`), must be HTTPS (`tools.py:126`), and are stripped from the environment (`:139`).
- **Preferred:** CI-level interception. The runner maps astrid.haus to a local HTTPS server whose certificate only that runner trusts, so product code is unchanged.
- **Fallback:** a runtime-gated seam that fails closed, needs a stand-in marker and a pinned digest, and has no HTTP way to set it. It needs owner approval.

### UR-13 Hosted button path
- **What changes:** the update leg of `journey_fresh_update.py` (about :126) and `windows_update_journey.py` (about :225). It is a POST with Origin `https://astrid.haus`, `Content-Length: 0`, no Authorization or Cookie, and the server-side `installer:update` scope.
- **Hard-coded release:** fix `release == 1` (`journey_fresh_update.py:24-25`, `windows_update_journey.py:185`, `ci_journey_keepgoing.py:238`).
- **Probes first:** launchd (macOS) and the Windows interactive scheduled task on hosted runners.
