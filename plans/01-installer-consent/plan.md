# 1 — Merge completed installer consent

**Vision gaps:** [Trustworthy user control](../../vision/gaps/F-002-safe-user-control.md) (primary).

**Contributing:** [Astrid development skill](../../skills/astrid-dev/SKILL.md).

Deliver the accepted installer consent increment on Agent and App, with clear choices, saved preferences, and predictable installation behavior. Preserve the accepted nonblocking skills-off rendering limitation; this increment does not claim to fix it.

## Goal and scope

- **Included:** Integrate the four accepted Agent/App donors, resolve the consent and boundary-handoff interaction, regenerate App pins from the verified Agent candidate, and publish only the reviewed Agent/App heads.
- **Deferred:** Generation, concurrent editing, Packs, CPU generation, and broad suites. Runtime, VibeComfy, and lifecycle remain unchanged producers.
- **Authority:** This plan documents accepted work; it does not start product execution. Existing run and publication limits remain in force.

## What we build on

The two accepted donor tips per repository are required inputs. Their sibling merge probes passed. The work must preserve installer boundaries, both runtime locks, existing release semantics, and uninstall protections. Historical base observations and donor identities are recorded in [inputs.md](inputs.md).

## Sequence

Freeze current sources and selectors (**I-01**), compose and resolve the Agent handoff seam (**I-02**), compose App from the verified Agent candidate (**I-03**), independently review the exact tuple (**I-04**), then promote only the reviewed candidates (**I-05**). See [tasks.md](tasks.md) for accepted routes, checks, and evidence.

## Completion

Complete when the scoped Agent/App checks and independent review show preserved behavior, no blocking findings, and the exact reviewed heads are promoted to `pre-main` with a promotion manifest. This establishes only the installer-consent slice, not full initiative completion; Runtime, VibeComfy, and lifecycle are not updated.
