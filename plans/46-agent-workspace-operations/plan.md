# 46 — Agents can reshape the creative workspace

**Project:** Agents can reshape the creative workspace

**Goal:** Give agents the same safe, inspectable place, attach, resize, bind and restore operations as creators, allowing them to adapt an active workspace without disrupting the work.

**Status:** queued

**Owner:** Unassigned

**Estimate:** TBD

**Waiting on:** owner/scope agreement; source and dependency checks

**Start:** [Astrid development skill](../../skills/astrid-dev/SKILL.md) and [shared run contract](../../skills/astrid-dev-shared/run-contract.md). [Inputs](inputs.md) · [Tasks](tasks.md). The [catalog](../index.md) owns priority, status and owner.

**Vision gaps:** [LS-002 — Agents can reshape the creative workspace](../../vision/gaps/LS-002-agent-workspace-control.md) (primary).

## Goal and scope

Give agents the same safe, inspectable place, attach, resize, bind and restore operations as creators, allowing them to adapt an active workspace without disrupting the work.

**Included:** Agent inspection and reversible workspace operations, permission checks, explicit data bindings, presets and conflict recovery.

**Boundary:** No separate agent-only interface model, silent project-data mutation or accidental proximity-based connections.

## What this builds on

[Plan 24 layouts](../24-liquid-workspace/plan.md), [Plan 45 bindings](../45-component-connections/plan.md) and [Plan 04 concurrent edits](../04-concurrent-edits/plan.md). These are foundations to verify at current source revisions, not proof of a deployed result. Prefer reusing them over inventing another runtime or state owner.

## Proposed sequence

1. Expose validated workspace inspection/layout commands over Plan 24 operations.
2. Connect Plan 45 bindings with agent permission gates and reversible previews.
3. Build a music editing preset around existing music.beats and timeline authority.
4. Test equivalent human/agent actions, concurrent edits, invalid commands and rollback.

## Interfaces and handoff

Before product work, pin actual accepted base/donor revisions, implementation owners and dependencies. Consume existing pack/component/project contracts; produce a tested contract or working artifact and link exact product PRs. Never infer authorization from a draft.

## Completion

Test equivalent human/agent actions, concurrent edits, invalid commands and rollback. Record integrated candidate identity, real creator/agent outcomes and meaningful negative cases. Completion does not automatically close the associated vision gap.

**Authorization:** Draft, unassigned, queued. Owner decision and focused checks are required before implementation.
