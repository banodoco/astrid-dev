# Eliminate technical wrangling

## Statement

Technical wrangling should be work for your agents, not work that interrupts your art.

## Explanation

Models still need installing, environments still break, and jobs still fail. The aim is not to pretend this work disappears, but to empower agents to handle it: setting up and maintaining tools, managing dependencies, running jobs, and recovering from problems. Artists should stay immersed in creating while retaining control over consequential decisions.

## Aspirations

### Agents handle the setup

Your agent should make a tool ready to use, not hand you another setup guide.

Agents should find, install, configure, and update supported tools and models, resolve dependencies, and explain the decisions that genuinely require the creator's approval. The technical work remains real, but it should be streamlined through agents instead of transferred to the artist.

### Dependable execution and recovery

Agents should operate and repair creative tools without losing the artist's work.

Agents can monitor jobs, diagnose interruptions, handle recoverable failures, and arrange retries or rollback without losing the project, output, or creative intent. When they cannot safely repair something, they should surface a clear problem and options rather than leave the creator wrestling with an environment.

### Important decisions stay visible

Automation should not hide choices about permissions, cost, or where work runs.

Creators should understand the boundaries of agent actions and be able to approve, refuse, or revise consequential decisions, even when routine technical work is handled for them.

### One generation path, any engine, any machine

Every generation should run the same way wherever it runs and whatever runs it.

Start with the request and its requirements, choose a destination once, bring it into line when necessary, run on the chosen engine and return the result. Creators can set a default destination and override it for a generation. Workflows, engines and machines are independently replaceable pieces: adding one should reuse everything on the other side of its contract, rather than require another route through the core.

**We should:**

- Send every generation, in every modality, through one path.
- Make the engine a choice on that path: a cloud service, ComfyUI, Wan2GP or another inference engine.
- Make the machine a separate choice: this computer, your own server or a rented GPU.
- Let a new engine or machine plug in by meeting a declared contract, then work with everything on the other side.

**We should never:**

- Add a route for one modality or one pack just for now.
- Build an engine so that it only works with one kind of machine.
- Hide from the creator where a generation runs.
- Build our own inference engine.
